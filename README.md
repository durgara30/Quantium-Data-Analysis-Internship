# Successful Control Store Selection
We have identified control stores 233, 155, and 237 to pair with trial stores 77, 86, and 88.

* Promising Results
Our analysis indicates significant sales differences during at least two of the three trial months for trial stores 77 and 88. However, trial store 86 shows less variation, possibly due to trial implementation nuances.

* Further Investigation
To ensure a comprehensive understanding, we may consult with the client to investigate any differences in the trial's execution at store 86.

* Presentation Preparation
With our analysis concluded, we are ready to prepare our presentation for the Category Manager, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations.
